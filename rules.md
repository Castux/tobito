# Rules for Tobito, two players

- The game board is a 3x5 grid. Each player starts with three pawns in the row closest to them.
- Players alternate turns. During their turn, a player must move one of their pawn to any of the 8 directions, stopping in the first empty space. They may therefore jump over their and their opponent's pieces.
- All opponent pieces jumped over must be simultaneously moved to free spaces (other than the starting location of the jumping piece).
- A pawn that reaches the opposite row can no longer be moved or jumped over.
- Passivity rule: a player cannot make a move that leaves their starting row full of pieces of either player.
- The winner is the first player to bring their three pawns to the opposite row.
